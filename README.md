This is Claude Ando's basic R3F with Next.js setup. This setup is built on Next.js, SCSS, and R3F ecosystem libraries.

## Basic Structure.

1. Camera settings // PerspectiveCamera, OrbitControls etc.
2. Light settings  
3. Object declarations // 3D components such as boxes and  spheres.
4. Environment settings // Environment, ContactShadows etc
5. Other configurations //  such as GUI controls with Leva.

Each section should be broken down to individual components as your project grows.
